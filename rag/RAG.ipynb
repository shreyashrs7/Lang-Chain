      "the following is a conversation withdemus hasabisceo and co-founder of deepminda company that has published and buildssome of the most incredible artificialintelligence systems in the history ofcomputing including alfred zero thatlearnedall by itself to play the game of goldbetter than any human in the world andalpha fold two that solved proteinfoldingboth tasks considered nearly impossiblefor a very long timedemus is widely considered to be one ofthe most brilliant and impactful humansin the history of artificialintelligence and science and engineeringin generalthis was truly an honor and a pleasurefor me to finally sit down with him forthis conversation and i'm sure we willtalk many times again in the futurethis is the lex friedman podcast tosupport it please check out our sponsorsin the description and now dear friendshere's demishassabislet's start with a bit of a personalquestionam i an ai program you wrote tointerview people until i get good enoughto interview youwell i'll be impressed if if you werei'd be impressed by myself if you were idon't think we're quite up to that yetbut uh maybe you're from the future lexif you did would you tell me is that isthat a good thing to tell a languagemodel that's tasked with interviewingthat it is in fact um ai maybe we're ina kind of meta turing test uh probablyprobably it would be a good idea not totell you so it doesn't change yourbehavior right this is a kind ofheisenberg uncertainty principlesituation if i told you you behavedifferently yeah maybe that's what'shappening with us of course this is abenchmark from the future where theyreplay 2022 as a year before ais weregood enough yet and now we want to seeis it going to pass exactlyif i was such aprogram would you be able to tell do youthink so to the touring test questionyou've talked aboutthe benchmark for solving intelligencewhat would be the impressive thingyou've talked about winning a nobelprize in a system winning a nobel prizebut i still return to the touring testas a compelling test the spirit of thetouring test is a compelling testyeah the turing test of course it's beenunbelievably influential and turing'sone of my all-time heroes but i think ifyou look back at the 1950 papersoriginal paper and read the originalyou'll see i don't think he meant it tobe a rigorous formal test i think it wasmore like a thought experiment almost abit of philosophy he was writing if youlook at the style of the paper and youcan see he didn't specify it veryrigorously so for example he didn'tspecify the knowledge that the expert orjudge would have um not you know howmuch time would they have to investigatethis so these important parameters ifyou were gonna make it uh a true sort offormal testum and you know some by some measurespeople claimed the turing test passedseveral you know a decade ago i remembersomeone claiming that with a with a kindof very bog standard normal uhlogic model um because they pretended itwas a it was a kid so the the judgesthought that the machine you know waswas a was a child so um that would bevery different from an expert ai personuh interrogating a machine and knowinghow it was built and so on so i think umyou know we should probably move awayfrom that as a formal test and move moretowards a general test where we test theai capabilities on a range of tasks andsee if it reaches human level or aboveperformance on maybe thousands perhapseven millions of tasks eventually andcover the entire sort of cognitive spaceso i thinkfor its time it was an amazing thoughtexperiment and also 1950s obviously itwas barely the dawn of the computer ageso of course he only thought about textand now um we have a lot more differentinputsso yeah maybe the better thing to testis the generalizability so acrossmultiple tasks but i think it's alsopossible as as systems like god showthateventually that might map right back tolanguage so you might be able todemonstrate your ability to generalizeacross tasksby then communicating your ability togeneralize across tasks which is kind ofwhat we do through conversation anywaywhen we jump aroundultimately what's in there in thatconversation is not just you movingaround knowledgeit's you moving around like theseentirely different modalities ofunderstanding that ultimately map toyour ability toto uh operate successfully in all thesedomains which you can think of as tasksyeah i think certainly we as humans uselanguage as our main generalizationcommunication tool so i think we end upthinking in language and expressing oursolutions in language um so it's goingto be very powerfuluh uh mode in which to uh explain youknow the system to explain what it'sdoing um but i don't think it's the onlyuh uh modality that matters so i thinkthere's gonna be a lot of you knowthere's there's a lot of different waysto express uh capabilities uh other thanjust languageyeah visualrobotics body languageumyeah action is the interactive aspect ofall that that's all part of it butwhat's interesting with gato is thatit's a it's it's it's sort of pushingprediction to the maximum in terms oflike you know mapping arbitrarysequences to other sequences and sort ofjust predicting what's going to happennext so prediction seems to befundamental to intelligenceand what you're predictingdoesn't so much matter yeah it seemslike you can generalize that quite wellso obviously language models predict thenext word um gato predicts potentiallyany uh action or any token uh and it'sjust the beginning really it's our mostgeneral agent one could call it so farbut um you know that itself can bescaled up massively more than we've doneso far obviously we're in the in themiddle of doing that but the big part ofsolving agi is creating benchmarks thathelp us get closer and closer sort ofcreating benchmarks that test thejournalizability and it's just stillinteresting that this fella alan turingwas one of the first and probably stillone of the only people that was tryingmaybe philosophically but was trying toformulate a benchmark that could befollowed it iseven though it's it's fuzzy it's stillsufficiently rigorous to where you canrun that test and i still thinksomething like the touring test will atthe end of the daybe the thing that trulyimpresses other humansso that you can have a close friendwho's an ai systemfor that friend to be a good friendthey're going to have to be able touh play starcraftand they're going to have to do all ofthese tasks um get you a beer so therobotics tasksuh play games with you use languagehumor all those kinds of things but thatultimately can boil down to language itfeels like not in terms of the aicommunity but in terms of the actualimpact of general intelligence on theworld it feels like language will be theplace where it truly shines i think sobecause it's such an important kind ofinput output for us i think you're righti think the turing test that what thethe kind of the the philosophy behind itwhich is the idea of can can a machinemimic the behaviors of a human and menand i would say wider than just languageand textthen you know in terms of actions andeverything else creativity all thesethings then um if it can sort of matchor exceed human cognitive capabilitiesthen i think we have a you know trueintelligence so i thought from thatperspective you're right i think he didformulate the right uh kind of uh setupi just i think there'll be a kind ofhumorin the ai systems of the future lookingback to this conversationand thinking about the touring testand uh also thinking aboutby that time they would know which yearthey were finally able to sort of crossthe threshold of human levelintelligence and thinkhow funny it is that we humans werestillconfused about this whole problemthat has been long ago been solvedwell hello to the ai agents of thefuture anyway so going back to yourto your journey when did you fall inlove with programming firstwell it's pretty uh pretty young ageactually so umyou know i started off uh actually gameswas my first love so starting to playchess when i was around four years oldand then um it was actually withwinnings from a chess competition that imanaged to buy my first chess computerwhen i was about eight years old it wasa zx spectrum which was hugely popularin the uk at the timeand uh it's amazing machine because ithink it trained a whole generation ofprogrammers in the uk because it was soaccessible you know you literallyswitched it on and there was the basicprompt and you could just get going andum my parents didn't really knowanything about computers so but becauseit was my money from a chess competitioni could i could say i i wanted to buy ituh and then you know i just went tobookstores got books on programming andum started typing in you know theprogramming code and and then of courseum once you start doing that you startadjusting it and then making your owngames and that's when i fell in lovewith computers and realized that theywere a very magical device um in a way ikind of i would have been able toexplain this at the time but i felt thatthey were sort of almost a magicalextension of your mind i always had thisfeeling and i've always loved this aboutcomputers that you can set them offdoing something some task for you youcan go to sleep come back the next dayand it's solvedum you know that feels magical to me soi mean all machines do that to someextent they all enhance our naturalcapabilities obviously cars make usallow us to move faster than we can runbut this was a machine to extend themindand and then of course ai is theultimate expression of what a machinemay be able to do or learn sovery naturally for me that thoughtextended into into ai quite quicklyremember the the programming languagethat was firststartedspecial to the machine no it was justthe base it was just i think it was justbasic uh on the zx spectrum i don't knowwhat specific form it was and then lateron i got a commodore amiga which uhwas a fantastic machine no you're justshowing off so yeah well lots of myfriends had atari st's and i i managedto get amigas it was a bit more powerfuland uh and that was incredible and usedto do um programming in assembler andand uh also amos basic this thisspecific form of basic it was incredibleactually as well all my coding skillsand when did you fall in love with ai sowhen did you firststart to gain an understanding that youcan not just write programs thatdo some mathematical operations for youwhile you sleep but something that'sa keen tobringing an entity to lifesort ofa thing that can figure out somethingmore complicated than uhthan a simple mathematical operationyeah so there was a few stages for meall while i was very young so first ofall as i was trying to improve atplaying chess i was captaining variousengland junior chess teams and at thetime when i was about you know maybe 1011 years old i was gonna become aprofessional chess player that was myfirstthought um that dream was there sure shetried to get to the highest level yeahso i was um you know i got to when i wasabout 12 years old i got to master standand i was second highest rated player inthe world to judith polgar who obviouslyended up being an amazing chess playerand uh world women's champion and when iwas trying to improve at chess where youknow what you do is you obviously firstof all you're trying to improve your ownthinking processes so that leads you tothinking about thinking how is yourbrain coming up with these ideas why isit making mistakes how can you how canyou improve that thought process but thesecond thing is that you it was just thebeginning this was like in the in theearly 80s mid 80s of chess computers ifyou remember they were physical boardslike the one we have in front of us andyou pressed down the you know thesquares and i think kasparov had abranded version of it that i i i got andum you were you know used to they're notas strong as they are today but theywere they were pretty strong and youused to practice against them um to tryand improve your openings and otherthings and so i remember i think iprobably got my first one i was around11 or 12. and i remember thinking umthis is amazing you know how how hassomeone programmed uh uh this this chessboard to play chess uh and uh it wasvery formative book i bought which wascalled the chess computer handbook bydavid levy which came out in 1984 orsomething so i must have got it when iwas about 11 12 and it explained fullyhow these chess programs were made iremember my first ai program being uhprogramming my amiga it couldn't itwasn't powerful enough to play chess icouldn't write a whole chess program buti wrote a program for it to play othelloreversey it's sometimes called i thinkin the u.s and so a slightly simplergame than chess but i used all of theprinciples that chess programs had alphabeta search all of that and that was myfirst ai program i remember that verywell was around 12 years old so thatthat that brought me into ai and thenthe second part was later on uh when iwas around 1617 and i was writing gamesprofessionally designing games uhwriting a game called theme park whichum had ai as a core gameplay componentas part of the simulation um and it soldyou know millions of copies around theworld and people loved the way that theai even though it was relatively simpleby today's ai standards um was wasreacting to the way you as the playerplayed it so it was called a sandboxgame so it's one of the first types ofgames like that along with simcity andit meant that every game you played wasuniqueis there something you could say just ona small tangentaboutreally impressive ai from a game designhuman enjoyment perspectivereally impressive ai that you've seen ingames and maybe what does it take tocreate ai system and how hard of aproblem is that so a million questionsjust as a brief tangentwell look i think umgames uh games have been significant inmy life for three reasons so first ofall to to i was playing them andtraining myself on games when i was akid then i went through a phase ofdesigning games and writing ai4 games soall the games i i professionally wroteuh had ai as a core component and thatwas mostly in the in the 90s and thereason i was doing that in gamesindustry was at the time the gamesindustry i think was the cutting edge oftechnology so whether it was graphicswith people like john carmack and quakeand those kind of things or ai i thinkactually all the action was going on ingames and and we've seen we're stillreaping the benefits of that even withthings like gpus which you know i findironic was obviously invented forgraphics computer graphics but thenturns out to be amazingly useful for aiit just turns out everything's a matrixmultiplication it appears you know inthe whole worldso um so i think games at the time hadthe most cutting edge ai and a lot ofthe the games uh uh we you know i wasinvolved in writing so there was a gamecalled black and white which was onegame i was involved with in the earlystages of which i still think is themost umimpressive uh example of reinforcementlearning in a computer game so in thatgame you know you trained a little petanimal uh andyeah and it sort of learned from how youwere treating it so if you treated itbadly then it became mean yeah and thenit would be mean to to your villagersand your and your population the sort ofuh the little tribe that you wererunning uh but if you were kind to itthen it would be kind and people werefascinated by how that was and so was ito be honest with the way it kind ofdeveloped and um especially the mappingto good and evil yeah it made you madeyou realize made me realize that you cansort of in the way in the choices youmake can defineuh thewhere you end up and that meansall of us are capable of the gooduh evil it all matters in uh thedifferent choices along the trajectoryto those places that you make it'sfascinating i mean games can do thatphilosophically to you and it's rare itseems rare yeah well games are i think aunique medium because um you as theplayer you're not just passivelyconsuming the the entertainment rightyou're actually actively involved as anas a as an agent so i think that's whatmakes it in some ways can be morevisceral than other other mediums likeyou know films and books so the secondso that was you know designing ai andgames and then the third use uh uh i'vewe've used of ai is in deep mind fromthe beginning which is using games as atesting ground for proving out aialgorithms and developing ai algorithmsand that was a that was a sort of um acore component of our vision at thestart of deepmind was that we would usegames very heavily uh as our maintesting ground certainly to begin withum because it's super efficient to usegames and also you know it's very easyto have metrics to see how well yoursystems are improving and what directionyour ideas are going in and whetheryou're making incremental improvementsand because those games are often rootedin something that humans did for a longtime beforehandthere's already a strongset of rules like it's already a damngood benchmark yes it's really good forso many reasons because you've gotyou've got you've got clear measures ofhow good humans can be at these thingsand in some cases like go we've beenplaying it for thousands of years um andand uh often they have scores or atleast win conditions so it's very easyfor reward learning systems to get areward it's very easy to specify whatthat reward is um and uh also at the endit's easy to you know to test uhexternally you knowhow strong is your system by of courseplaying against you know the world'sstrongest players at those games so it'sit's so good for so many reasons andit's also very efficient to runpotentially millions of simulations inparallel on the cloud so um i thinkthere's a huge reason why we were sosuccessful back in you know starting out2010 how come we were able to progressso quickly because we'd utilize gamesand um you know at the beginning of deepmind we also hired some amazing gameengineers uh who i knew from my previousuh lives in the games industry and uhand that helped to bootstrap us veryquickly and plus it's somehow supercompelling almost at a philosophicallevel of man versus machineover over a chessboard or a go boardand especially given that the entirehistory of ai is defined by peoplesaying it's going to be impossible tomake a machine thatbeats a human being in chessand then once that happenedpeople were certain when i was coming upin ai that gois not a game that could be solvedbecause of the combinatorial complexityit's just too it's it's it's you knowno matter how much moore's law you havecompute is just never going to be ableto crack the game of go yeah and so thatthen there's something compelling aboutfacing sort of taking on theimpossibility of that task from theairesearcher perspective engineerperspective and then as a human beingjust observing this whole thingyourbeliefs about what you thought wasimpossiblebeing broken apartit's it's uh humblingto realize we're not as smart as wethoughtit's humbling to realize that the thingswe think are impossible now perhaps willbe donein the future there's somethingreally powerful about a game ai systembeing a human being in a game thatdrives that messageuh home for like millions billions ofpeople especially in the case of go surewell look i think it's a i mean it hasbeen a fascinating journey and andespecially as i i think about it from ican understand it from both sides bothas the aiyou know creators of the ai um but alsoas a games player originally so you knowit was a it was a really interesting itwas i mean it was a fantastic um butalso somewhat bittersweet moment thealphago match for me um uh seeing thatand and and being obviously heavilyheavily involved in that um but you knowas you say chess has been uh the i meankasparov i think rightly called it thedrosophila of of intelligence right soit's sort of i i love that phrase andand i think he's right because chess hasbeen um hand in hand with ai from thebeginning of the the whole field rightso i think every ai practitionerstarting with turing and claude shannonand all those uh the sort of forefathersof of of of the field um tried theirhand at writing a chess program uh i'vegot original audition of claudeshannon's first chess program i think itwas 1949 uh the the original sort of uhpaper and um they all did that andturing famously wrote a chess programthat but all the computers around therewere obviously too slow to run it so hehad to run he had to be the computerright so he literally i think spent twoor three days running his own program byhand with pencil and paper and playingplaying a friend of his uh with hischess program soof course deep blue was a huge moment uhbeatingoff um but actually when that happened iremember that very very vividly ofcourse because it was you know chess andcomputers and ai all the things i lovedand i was at college at the time but iremember coming away from that beingmore impressed by kasparov's mind than iwas by deep blue because here waskasparov with his human mind not onlycould he play chess more or less to thesame level as this brute of acalculation machine um but of coursekasparov can do everything else humanscan do ride a bike talk many languagesdo politics all the rest of the amazingthings that kasparov does and so withthe same brain yeah and and yet deepblue uh brilliant as it was at chess ithad been hand coded for chess and umactually had distilled the knowledge ofchess grand masters uh into into a coolprogram but it couldn't do anything elselike it couldn't even play a strictlysimpler game like tic-tac-toe so umsomething to me was missing from umintelligence from that system that wewould regard as intelligence and i thinkit was this idea of generality and andalso learning yeah um so and that's whatwe tried to do out with alphago yeah wealphago and alpha zero mu zero and thengot on all the things that uh we'll getinto some parts of there's just afascinating trajectory here but let'sjust stick on chess briefly uh on thehuman side of chess you've proposed thatfrom a game design perspective the thingthat makes chesscompelling as a gameuh is that there's a creative tensionbetween a bishopand the knightcan you explain this first of all it'sreally interesting to think about whatmakes the game compellingmakes it stick across centuriesyeah i was sort of thinking about thisand actually a lot of even amazing chessplayers don't think about it necessarilyfrom a games designer point of view soit's with my game design hat on that iwas thinking about this why is chess socompellingand i think a critical uh reason is thethe dynamicness of of of the differentkind of chess positions you can havewhether they're closed or open and otherthings comes from the bishop and thenight so if you think about howdifferent the the the capabilities ofthe bishop and knight are in terms ofthe way they move and then somehow chesshas evolved to balance those twocapabilities more or less equally sothey're both roughly worth three pointseach so you think that dynamics wasalways there and then the rest of therules are kind of trying to stabilizethe game well maybe i mean it's sort ofi don't know his chicken and eggsituation probably both came togetherbut the fact that it's got to thisbeautiful equilibrium where you can havethe bishop and knight they're sodifferent in power um but so equal invalue across the set of the universe ofall positions right somehow they've beenbalanced by humanity over hundreds ofyears um i think gives gives the gamethe creative tension uh that you canswap the bishop and knights uh for abishop for a knight and you you they'remore or less worth the same but now youaim for a different type of position ifyou have the knight you want a closedposition if you have the bishop you wantan open position so i think that createsa lot of the creative tension in chessso some kind of controlled creativetensionfrom an ai perspectivedo you think ai systems conventiondesign games that are optimallycompelling to humanswell that's an interesting question youknow sometimes i get asked aboutai and creativity and and this and theway i answered that is relevant to thatquestion which is that i think they'redifferent levels of creativity one couldsay so i think um if we definecreativity as coming up with somethingoriginal right that's that's useful fora purpose then you know i think the kindof lowest level of creativity is like aninterpolation so an averaging of all theexamples you see so maybe a very basicai system could say you could have thatso you show it millions of pictures ofcats and then you say give me an averagelooking cat right generate me an averagelooking cat i would call thatinterpolation then there's extrapolationwhich something like alphago showed soalphago played you know millions ofgames of go against itselfand then it came up with brilliant newideas like move 37 in game two bringinga motif strategies and go that that nohumans had ever thought of even thoughwe've played it for thousands of yearsand professionally for hundreds of yearsso that that i call that extrapolationbut then that's still there's still alevel above that which is you know youcould call out the box thinking or trueinnovation which is could you invent goright could you invent chess and notjust come up with a brilliant chess moveor brilliant go move but can you can youactually invent chess or something asgood as chess or go and i think one dayuh ai could but what's missing is howwould you even specify that task to a aprogram right now and the way i would doit if i was best telling a human to doit or a games designer a human gamesdesigner to do it is i would saysomething like go i would say umcome up with a game that only takes fiveminutes to learn which go does becauseit's got simple rules but many lifetimesto master right or impossible to masterin one lifetime because so deep and socomplex um and then it's aestheticallybeautiful uh and also uh it can becompleted in three or four hours ofgameplay time which is you know usefulfor our us you know in in a human dayand so um you might specify these sideof high level concepts like that andthen you know with that and maybe a fewother things uh one could imagine thatgo satisfies uh those those constraintsum but the problem is is that we we'renot able to specify abstract notionslike that high-level abstract notionslike that yet to our ai systems um and ithink there's still something missingthere in terms of um high-level conceptsor abstractions that they trulyunderstand and that you know combinableand compositional um so for the momenti think ai is capable of doinginterpolation extrapolation but not trueinvention so coming up with rule setsuh and optimizingwith complicated objectives around thoserule sets we can't currently dobut you could take a specific rule setand then run a kind of self-playexperiment to see how longjust observe how an ai system fromscratch learns how long is that journeyof learning and maybeif it satisfies some of those otherthings you mentioned in terms ofquickness to learn and so on and youcould see a long journey to master foreven an ai system then you could saythat this is a promising gameum but it would be nice to do almostlike alpha codes or programming rules sogenerating rules that kind ofuhthat automate even that part of thegeneration of rules so i have thoughtabout systems actually um that i thinkwould be amazing in in for a gamesdesigner if you could have a system thatum takes your game plays it tens ofmillions of times maybe overnight andthen self balances the rules better soit tweaks the the rules and the maybethe equations and the and the and theparameters so that the game uh is morebalanced the units in the game orsome of the rules could be tweaked soit's a bit of like a giving a base setand then allowing a monte carlo treesearch or something like that to sort ofexplore it right and i think that wouldbe super super a powerful tool actuallyfor for balancing auto balancing a gamewhich usually takesthousands of hours from hundreds ofgames human games testers normally to tobalance some one you know game likestarcraft which is you know blizzard areamazing at balancing their games but ittakes them years and years and years soone could imagine at some point whenthis uh this stuff becomes uh efficientenough to you know you might be able todo that like overnightdo you think a game that is optimaldesigned by an ai systemwould look very much like uh planetearthmaybe maybe it's only the sort of game iwould love to make is is and i've triedyou know my in my game's career thegames design career you know my firstbig game was designing a theme park anamusement park then uh with games likerepublic i tried to you know have gameswhere we designed whole cities and andallowed you to play in so and of coursepeople like will wright have writtengames like sim earth uh trying tosimulate the whole of earth prettytricky but um i see earth i haven'tactually played that one so what is itdoes it incorporative evolution or yeahit has evolution and it's sort of um ittries to it sort of treats it as anentire biosphere but from quite a highlevelsonice to be able to sort of zoom in zoomout zoom in exactly so obviously hecouldn't do that was in the night ithink he wrote that in the 90s so itcouldn't you know it wasn't it wasn'table to do that but that that would beuh obviously the ultimate sandbox gameof courseon that topic do you think we're livingin a simulationyes well so okay so i'm gonna jumparound from the absurdly philosophicalto the short term sure very very happyto so i think uh my answer to thatquestion is a little bit complex becauseuh there is simulation theory whichobviously nick bostrom i think famouslyfirst proposed umand uh i don't quite believe it in inthat sense so um in the in the sensethat uh are we in some sort of computergame or have our descendants somehowrecreated uh uh earth in the you know21st century and and some for some kindof experimental reason i think that umbut i do think that we that that wemight be that the best way to understandphysics and the universe is from acomputational perspective sounderstanding it as an informationuniverse and actually information beingthe most fundamental unit of uh realityrather than matter or energy so aphysicist would say you know matter orenergy you know e equals m c squaredthese are the things that are are thefundamentals of the universe i'dactually say information um which ofcourse itself can be can specify energyor matter right matter is actually justyou know we're we're just out the wayour bodies and all the molecules in ourbody arrange is information so i thinkinformation may be the most fundamentalway to describe the universe andtherefore you could say we're in somesort of simulation because of that umbut i don't i do i'm not i'm not reallya subscriber to the idea that um youknow these are sort of throw awaybillions of simulations around i thinkthis is actually very critical andpossibly unique this simulationparticular one yes so but and you justmeantreating the universeas a computerthat'sprocessing and modifying informationis is a good way to solve the problemsof physics of chemistry of biologyand perhaps of humanity and so on yes ithink understanding physics in terms ofinformation theory uh might be the bestway to to really uh understand what'sgoing on herefrom our understanding of a universalturing machine from our understanding ofa computer do you think there'ssomething outside of the capabilities ofa computer that is present in ouruniverse you have a disagreement withroger penrosethe nature of consciousness he he thinksthat consciousness is more than just acomputationuh do you think all of it the wholeshebang is can be can be a competitionyeah i've had many fascinating debateswith uh sir roger penrose and obviouslyhe's he's famously and i read you knowemperors of new mind and and umand his books uh his classical books uhand they they were pretty influentialand you know in the 90s and um hebelieves that there's something more youknow something quantum that is needed toexplain consciousness in the brain um ithink about what we're doing actually atdeepmind and what my career is beingwe're almost like true rings champion sowe are pushing turing machines orclassical computation to the limits whatare the limits of what classicalcomputing can do now um and at the sametime i've also studied neuroscience tosee and that's why i did my phd in wasto see also to look at you know is thereanything quantum in the brain from aneuroscience or biological perspectiveand um and so far i think mostneuroscientists and most mainstreambiologists and neuroscientists would saythere's no evidence of any quantum uhsystems or effects in the brain as faras we can see it's it can be mostlyexplained by classical uh classicaltheories soand then so there's sort of the thesearch from the biology side and then atthe same time there's the raising of thewater uh at the bar from what classicalturing machines can do uh uh andand you know including our new aisystems and uh as you alluded to earlierum you know i think ai especially in thelast decade plus has been a continualstory now of surprising uh events uh andsurprising successes knocking over onetheory after another of what was thoughtto be impossible you know from go toprotein folding and so on and so i thinkumi would be very hesitant to bet againsthow far the uh universal turing machineand classical computation paradigm cango and and my betting would bethat all of certainly what's going on inour brain uh can probably be mimicked oror approximated on a on a classicalmachine um not you know not requiringsomething metaphysical or quantum andwe'll get there with some of the workwith alpha foldwhich i think begins the journey ofmodeling this beautiful and complexworld of biology so you think all themagic of the human mind comes from thisjust a few pounds of mushof a biological computational mushthat'sakin to some of the neural networksnot directly but in spirit that deepmind has been working with well look ithink it's um you say it's a few youknow of course it's this is the i thinkthe biggest miracle of the universe isthat um it is just a few pounds of mushin our skulls and yet it's also ourbrains are the most complex objects inthe in that we know of in the universeso there's something profoundlybeautiful and amazing about our brainsandithink that it's an incredibly uhincredible efficient machine and and uhuhand it's a is you know phenomenalbasically and i think that building aione of the reasons i want to build aiand i've always wanted to is i think bybuilding an intelligent artifact like aiand then comparing it to the human mindum that will help us unlock theuniqueness and the true secrets of themind that we've always wondered aboutsince the dawn of history likeconsciousness dreaming uh creativity uhemotions what are all these things rightwe've we've wondered about them sincesince the dawn of humanity and i thinkone of the reasons and you know i lovephilosophy and philosophy of mind is wefound it difficult is there haven't beenthe tools for us to really other thanintrospection to from very clever peoplein in history very clever philosophersto really investigate thisscientifically but now suddenly we havea plethora of tools firstly we have allthe neuroscience tools fmri machinessingle cell recording all of this stuffbut we also have the ability computersand ai to build uh intelligent systemsso i think that umuhyou know i think it is amazing what thehuman mind does and um and and i'm kindof in awe of it really and uh and ithink it's amazing that without humanminds we're able to build things likecomputers and and actually even you knowthink and investigate about thesequestions i think that's also atestament to the human mind yeah theuniverse built the human mind that nowis building computers that helpus understand both the universe and ourown human mind right that's exactly it imean i think that's one you know onecould say we we aremaybe we're the mechanism by which theuniverse is going to try and understanditself yeahit's beautiful so let's let's go to thebasic building blocks of biology that ithinkis another angle at which you can startto understand the human mind the humanbody which is quite fascinating which isfrom the basic building blocks start tosimulate start to modelhow from those building blocks you canconstruct bigger and bigger more complexsystems maybe one day the entirety ofthe human biology sohere's another problem that thought tobe impossible to solve which is proteinfolding and alpha fold orspecific alpha fold 2did just that it solved protein foldingi think it's one of the biggestbreakthroughsuh certainly in the history ofstructural biology but uh in general inin scienceummaybe from a high levelwhat is it and how does it workand then we can ask some fascinatingsure questions after sure um so maybelike to explain it uh to people notfamiliar with protein folding is youknow i first of all explain proteinswhich is you know proteins are essentialto all life every function in your bodydepends on proteins sometimes they'recalled the workhorses of biology and ifyou look into them and i've you knowobviously as part of alpha fold i'vebeen researching proteins and andstructural biology for the last fewyears you know they're amazing littlebio nano machines proteins they'reincredible if you actually watch littlevideos of how they work animations ofhow they workand um proteins are specified by theirgenetic sequence called the amino acidsequence so you can think of those theirgenetic makeup and then in the body uhin in nature they when they when theyfold up into a 3d structure so you canthink of it as a string of beads andthen they fold up into a ball now thekey thing is you want to know what that3d structure isbecause the structure the 3d structureof a proteinis what helps to determine what does itdo the function it does in your bodyand also if you're interested in drugdrugs or disease you need to understandthat 3d structure because if you want totarget something with a drug compound orabout to block that something theprotein is doing uh you need tounderstand where it's going to bind onthe surface of the protein so obviouslyin order to do that you need tounderstand the 3d structure so thestructure is mapped to the function thestructure is mapped to the function andthe structure is obviously somehowspecified by the by the amino acidsequence and that's the in essence theprotein folding problem is can you justfrom the amino acid sequence theone-dimensionalstring of letters can youimmediately computationally predict the3d structure right and this has been agrand challenge in biology for over 50years so i think it was firstarticulated by christian anfinsen anobel prize winner in 1972 uh as part ofhis nobel prize winning lecture and hejust speculated this should be possibleto go from the amino acid sequence tothe 3d structure we didn't say how soi you know it's been described to me asequivalent to fermat's last theorem butfor biology right you should as somebodythat uh very well might win the nobelprize in the future but outside of thatyou should do more of that kind of thingin the margins just put random thingsthat will take like 200 years to solveset people off for 200 years it shouldbe possible exactly and just don't giveany interest exactly i think everyone'sexactly should be i'll have to rememberthat for future so yeah so he set offyou know with this one throwaway remarkjust like fermat you know he he set offthis whole 50-year uhuh uh field really of computationalbiology and and they had you know theygot stuck they hadn't really got veryfar with doing this and and um until nowuntil alpha fold came along this is doneexperimentally right very painstakinglyso the rule of thumb is and you have tolike crystallize the protein which isreally difficult some proteins can't becrystallized like membrane proteins andthen you have to use very expensiveelectron microscopes or x-raycrystallography machines reallypainstaking work to get the 3d structureand visualize the 3d structure so therule of thumb in in experimental biologyis that it takes one phd student theirentire phd to do one protein uh and withalpha fold two we were able to predictthe 3d structure in a matter of secondsum and so we were you know overchristmas we did the whole humanproteome or every protein in the humanbody all 20 000 proteins so the humanproteins like the equivalent of thehuman genome but on protein space and uhand sort of revolutionize really what uha structural biologist can do becausenow um they don't have to worry aboutthese painstaking experimentals you knowshould they put all of that effort in ornot they can almost just look up thestructure of their proteins like agoogle searchand so there's a data set on which it'strained and how to map this amino acidsbecause first of all it's incrediblethat a protein this little chemicalcomputer is able to do that computationitself in some kind of distributed wayand do it very quicklythat's a weird thing and they evolvedthat way because you know in thebeginningi mean that's a great invention just theprotein itself yes i mean and then theythere's i think probably a history oflike uh they evolvedto have many of these proteins and thoseproteins figure out how to be computersthemselvesin such a way that you can createstructures that can interact incomplexes with each other in order toform high level functions i mean it's aweird system that they figured it outwell for sure i mean we you know maybewe should talk about the origins of lifetoo but proteins themselves i think aremagical and incredible uh uh uh as isaid little little bio-nano machines andumand and actually levantal who is anotherscientist uh uh a contemporary ofanfinsen uh he he coined this eleventhhouse what became known as levantal'sparadox which is exactly what you'resaying he calculated roughly a proteinan average protein which is maybe 2 000amino acidsbases long is umis is can fold in maybe 10 to the power300 different conformations so there's10 to the power 300 different ways thatprotein could fold up and yet somehow innature physics solves this solves thisin a matter of milliseconds so proteinsfold up in your body in you knowsometimes in fractions of a second sophysics is somehow solving that searchproblem and just to be clear in many ofthese cases maybe you correct me if i'mwrong there's often a unique wayfor that sequence to form itself yes soamong that huge number of possibilitiesyes it figures out a way how tostabilityuhin some cases there might be amisfunction so on which leads to a lotof the disorders and stuff like that butyes most of the time it's a uniquemapping and that unique mapping is notobvious no exactly that's just what theproblem is exactly so there's a uniquemapping usually in a healthy in if it'shealthy and as you say in diseaseso for example alzheimer's one one oneconjecture is that it's because of amisfolded protein a protein that foldsin the wrong way amyloid beta protein soum and then because it falls in thewrong way it gets tangled up right inyour in your neurons soum it's super important to understandboth healthy functioning and alsodisease is to understand uh you knowwhat what these things are doing and howthey're structuring of course the nextstep is sometimes proteins change shapewhen they interact with something so umthey're not just static necessarily inin biologymaybe you can give some interesting sortof beautiful things to you about theseearly days of alpha fold of of solvingthis problem becauseunlike games this isreal physical systems that are lessamenable toself-play type of mechanismsthe the size of the data set is smallerthat you might otherwise like so youhave to be very clever about certainthings is there something you couldspeak to umwhat was very hard to solve and what aresome beautiful aspects about the thesolution yeah i would say alpha fold isthe most complex and also probably mostmeaningful system we've built so far soit's been an amazing time actually inthe last you know two three years to seethat come through because um as wetalked about earlier you know games iswhat we started on uh building thingslike alphago and alpha zero but reallythe ultimate goal was to um not just tocrack games it was just to to to builduse them to bootstrap general learningsystems we could then apply to realworld challenges specifically my passionis scientific challenges like proteinfolding and then alpha fold of course isour first big proof point of that and soum you know in terms of the data uh andthe amount of innovations that had to gointo it we you know it was like morethan 30 different component algorithmsneeded to be put together to crack theprotein folding um i think some of thebig innovations were that umkind of building in some hard codedconstraints around physics andevolutionary biology um to constrainsort of things like the bond angles uhuh in the in the in the protein andthings like that uma lot but not to impact the learningsystem so still allowing uh the systemto be able to learn the physics uhitself um from the examples that we hadand the examples as you say there areonly about 150 000 proteins even after40 years of experimental biology onlyaround 150 000 proteins have been thestructures have been found out about sothat was our training set which is ummuch less than normally we would like tousebut using various tricks things likeself distillation so actually usingalpha folds predictions um some of thebest predictions that it thought washighly confident in we put them backinto the training set right to make thetraining set biggerthat was critical to to alpha foldworking so there was actually a hugenumber of different um uh innovationslike that that were required to toultimately crack the problem after foldone what it produced was a distagram soa kind ofa matrix of the pairwise distancesbetween all of the molecules in the inthe in the protein and then there had tobe a separate optimization process to uhcreate the 3d structureand what we did for alpha volt2 is makeit truly end to end so we went straightfrom the amino acid sequence of of ofbases tothe 3d structure directly without goingthrough this intermediate step and inmachine learning what we've always foundis that the more end to end you can makeit the better the system and it'sprobably because um we you know the inthe end the system is better at learningwhat the constraints are than than weare as the human designers of specifyingit so anytime you can let it flow end toend and actually just generate what itis you're really looking for in thiscase the 3d structure you're better offthan having this intermediate step whichyou then have to hand craft the nextstep for soso it's better to let the gradients andthe learning flow all the way throughthe system um from the end point the endoutput you want to the inputs so that'sa good way to start a new problemhandcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunchof manual constraints with a smallintent learning piece or a smalllearning piece and grow that learningpiece until it consumes the whole thingthat's right and so you can also see youknow this is a bit of a method we'vedeveloped over doing many sort ofsuccessful outfits we call them alpha xprojects right is and the easiest way tosee that is the evolution of alphago toalpha zero so alphago was um a learningsystem but it was specifically trainedto only play go right so uh and what wewanted to do with first version of go isjust get to world champion performanceno matter how we did it right and thenand then of course alphago zero we we weremoved the need to use human games as astarting point right so it could justplay against itself from random startingpoint from the beginning so that removedthe the need for human knowledge uhabout go and then finally alpha zerothen generalized it so that any thingswe had in there the system includingthings like symmetry of the go board uhwere removed so the alpha zero couldplay from scratch any two player gameand then mu0 which is the finallatest version of that set of things wasthen extending it so that you didn'teven have to give it the rules of thegame it would learn that for itself soit could also deal with computer gamesas well as board games so that line ofalpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zerothat's the full trajectory of what youcan take fromuh imitation learningto full selfsupervised learning yeah exactly andlearning learning uh the entirestructure of the environment you put infrom scratch right and and and andbootstrapping it uh through self-play uhyourself but the thing is it would havebeen impossible i think or very hard forus to build alpha zero or mu0 first outof the boxeven psychologically because you have tobelieve in yourself for a very long timeyou're constantly dealing with doubtbecause a lot of people say that it'simpossible exactly so it was hard enoughjust to do go as you were sayingeveryone thought that was impossible orat least a decade away um from when wewhen we did it back in 2015 24 you know2016 and umand so yes it would have beenpsychologically probably very difficultas well as the fact that of course welearnt a lot by building alphago firstright so it's i think this is why i callai in engineering science it's one ofthe most fascinating science disciplinesbut it's also an engineering science inthe sense that unlike natural sciencesum the phenomenon you're studying itdoesn't exist out in nature you have tobuild it first so you have to build theartifact first and then you can studyhow how and pull it apart and how itworks this is tough to uhask you this question because youprobably will say it's everything butlet's let's try let's try to think tothis because you're in a veryinteresting position where deepmind isthe place of some of the most uhbrilliant ideas in the history of ai butit's also a place of brilliantengineeringso how much of solving intelligence thisbig goal for deepmind how much of it isscience how much is engineering so howmuch is the algorithms how much is thedata how much is thehardware compute infrastructure how muchis it the software computerinfrastructure yeah um what else isthere how much is the humaninfrastructureand like just the humans interact incertain kinds of ways in all the spaceof all those ideas how much does maybelike philosophy how much what's the keyif umuhif if you were to sort of look back likeif we go forward 200 years look backwhat was the key thing that solvedintelligence is that ideasi think it's a combination first of allof course it's a combination of allthose things but the the ratios of themchanged over over timeso yeah so um even in the last 12 yearsso we started deep mine in 2010 which ishard to imagine now because 2010 it'sonly 12 short years ago but nobody wastalking about ai uh you know if youremember back to your mit days you knowno one was talking about it i did apostdoc at mit back around then and itwas sort of thought of as a well look weknow ai doesn't work we tried this hardin the 90s at places like mit mostlylosing using logic systems andold-fashioned sort of good old-fashionedai we would call it now um people likeminsky and and and patrick winston andyou know all these characters right andused to debate a few of them and theyused to think i was mad thinking aboutthat some new advance could be done withlearning systems and um i was actuallypleased to hear that because at leastyou know you're on a unique track atthat point right even if every all ofyour you know professors are telling youyou're mad that's true and of course inindustry uh you can we couldn't get youknow as difficult to get two centstogether uh and which is hard to imaginenow as well given it's the biggest sortof buzzword in in vcs and andfundraising's easy and all these kind ofthings today soback in 2010 it was very difficult andwhat we the reason we started then andshane and i used to discuss um uh uhwhat were the sort of founding tenets ofdeep mind and it was very various thingsone was um algorithmic advances so deeplearning you know jeff hinton and cohenjust had just sort of invented that inacademia but no one in industry knewabout it uh we love reinforcementlearning we thought that could be scaledup but also understanding about thehuman brain had advanced um quite a lotuh in the decade prior with fmrimachines and other things so we couldget some good hints about architecturesand algorithms and and sort of umrepresentations maybe that the brainuses so as at a systems level not at aimplementation level um and then theother big things were compute and gpusright so we could see a compute wasgoing to be really useful and it got toa place where it became commoditizedmostly through the games industry andand that could be taken advantage of andthen the final thing was alsomathematical and theoretical definitionsof intelligence so things like ai xi aixwhich uh shane worked on with hissupervisor marcus hutter which is a sortof theoretical uh proof really ofuniversal intelligence um which isactually a reinforcement learning systemum in the limit i mean it assumesinfinite compute and infinite memory inthe way you know like a turing machineproof but i was also waiting to seesomething like that too to you know liketuring machines uh and and computationtheory that people like turing andshannon came up with underpins moderncomputer science um uh you know i waswaiting for a theory like that to sortof underpin agi research so when i youknow met shane and saw he was working onsomething like that you know that to mewas a sort of final piece of the jigsawsoin the early days i would say thatideas were the most important uh youknow and for us it was deepreinforcement learning scaling up deeplearning um of course we've seentransformers so huge leaps i would sayyou know three or four from for if youthink from 2010 until now uh hugeevolutions things like alphago um and umand and maybe there's a few more stillneeded but as we get closer to ai agi umi think engineering becomes more andmore important and data because scaleand of course the the recent you knowresults of gpt3 and all the big languagemodels and large models including ourones uh has shown that scale is a is andlarge models are clearly going to beunnecessary but perhaps not sufficientpart of an agi solution andthroughout that like you said and i'dlike to give you a big thank you you'reone of the pioneers in this issticking by ideas like reinforcementlearning that this can actually workgiven actuallylimited success in the pastand alsowhich we still don't know butproudlyhaving the best researchers in the worldand talking about solving intelligenceso talking about whatever you call itagi or something like thisthat speaking of mit that's that's justsomething not you wouldn't bring up nouh not not maybe you did in uh like 4050 years agobut that wasumai was a place where you do tinkeringvery small scale not very ambitiousprojects andmaybe the biggest ambitious projectswere in the space of robotics and doinglike the darpa challenge sure but thetask of solving intelligence andbelieving you canthat's really really powerful soin order for engineering to do its workto have great engineers build greatsystems you have to have that beliefthat threats throughout the whole thingthat you can actually solve some ofthese impossible challenges yeah that'sright and and back in 2010 you know ourmission statement um and still is todayyou know it was used to be uh solvingstep one solve intelligence step two useit to solve everything else yes so ifyou can imagine pitching that to a vc in2010 you know the kind of looks we wegot we managed to you know find a few uhkooky people to back us but it was uh itwas tricky and and i and i got to thepoint where we we wouldn't mention it toany of our professors because they wouldjust eye roll and think we you knowcommitted career suicide and and uh andand you know so it was there's a lot ofthings that we had to do but we alwaysbelieved it and one reason you know bythe way one reason we i believe i'vealways believed in reinforcementlearning is thatthat if you look at neuroscience that isthe way that the you know primate brainlearns one of the main mechanisms is thedopamine system implement some form oftd learning a very famous result in thelate 90s uh where they saw this inmonkeys and uh and as a you know propergame prediction error so we you knowagain in the limit this is this is whati think you can use neuroscience for isis you know any at mathematics you whenyou're when you're doing something asambitious as trying to solveintelligence and you're you're you knowit's blue sky research no one knows howto do it you you you need to use anyevidence or any source of informationyou can to help guide you in the rightdirection or give you confidence you'regoing in the right direction so so thatthat was one reason we pushed so hard onthat and that's and just going back toyour early question about organizationthe other big thing that i think weinnovated with at deepmind to encourageinvention and and uh and innovation wasthe multi-disciplinary organization webuilt and we still have today sodeepmind originally was a confluence ofthe of the most cutting-edge knowledgein neuroscience with machine learningengineering and mathematics right andand gamingand then since then we built that outeven further so we have philosophershere and and uh by you know ethicistsbut also other types of scientistsphysicists and so on um and that's whatbrings together i tried to build a sortof um new type of bell labs but in thisgolden era right uhand and a new expression of that um totry and uh foster this incredible sortof innovation machine so talking aboutthe humans in the machinethe mind itself is a learning machinewith a lots of amazing human minds in itcoming together to try and build theseuh learning systemsif we return tothe big ambitious dream of alpha foldthat may be the early steps on a verylong journey in umin biologydo you think the same kind of approachcan use to predict the structure andfunction of more complex biologicalsystems so multi-protein interactionand theni mean you can go out from there justsimulating bigger and bigger systemsthat eventually simulate something likethe human brain or the human body justthe big mush the mess of the beautifulresilient mesobiology do do you see thatas a long-term vision i do and i thinkumyou know if you think about what are thethings top things i wanted to apply aiai2 once we had powerful enough systemsbiology and curing diseases andunderstanding biology uh was right upthere you know top of my list that's oneof the reasons i personally pushed thatmyself and with alpha fold but i thinkalpha fold uh amazing as it is is justthe beginning um and and and i hope it'sevidence of uh what could be done withcomputational methods so um you knowalpha fold solve this this huge problemof the structure of proteins but biologyis dynamic so really what i imagine fromhere we're working on all these thingsnow is protein protein interaction uhprotein ligand binding so reacting withmolecules um then you want to get buildup to pathways and then eventually avirtual cell that's my dream uh maybe inthe next 10 years and i've been talkingactually to a lot of biologists friendsof mine paul nurse who runs the qrikinstitute amazing biologist nobel prizewinning biologist we've been discussingfor 20 years now virtual cells could youbuild a virtual simulation of a cell andif you could that would be incrediblefor biology and disease discoverybecause you could do loads ofexperiments on the virtual cell and thenonly at the last stage validate it inthe wet lab so you could you know interms of the search space of discoveringnew drugs you know it takes 10 yearsroughly to go from uh uh to to go fromuh you know identifying a target to uhhaving a drug candidate um maybe thatcould be shortened to you know by anorder of magnitude with if you could domost of that that that work in silico soin order to get to a virtual cellwe have to build up uh uh understandingof different parts of biology and theinteractions and and um so you knowevery every few years we talk about thiswith i talked about this with paul andthen finally last year after alpha faulti said now is the time we can finally gofor it and and alpha falls the firstproof point that this might be possibleuh and he's very excited when we havesome collaborations with his with hislab they're just across the roadactually from us as you know wonderfulbeing here in king's cross with thequick institute across the road and umand i think the next steps you know ithink there's going to be some amazingadvances in biology built on top ofthings like alpha fold uh we're alreadyseeing that with the community doingthat after we've open sourced it andreleased it um and uh you know i also ioften say that i thinkuh if you think of mathematics is theperfect description language for physicsi think ai might be end up being theperfect description language for biologybecausebiology is so messy it's so emergent sodynamic and complex um i think i find itvery hard to believe we'll ever get tosomething as elegant as newton's laws ofmotions to describe a cell right it'sjust too complicated um so i think ai isthe right tool for this you have to uhyou have to start at the basic buildingblocks and use ai to run the simulationfor all those building blocks so have avery strong way to do prediction of whatgiven these building blocks what kind ofbiology how thethe functionand the evolution of that biologicalsystemit's almost like a cellular automata youhave to run you can't analyze it from ahigh level you have to take the basicingredients figure out the rules yeahand let it run but in this case therules are very difficult to figure outyes yes learn them that's exactly it soit's the biology is too complicated tofigure out the rules it's it's it's tooemergent too dynamic say compared to aphysics system like the motion of aplanet yeah right and and so you have tolearn the rules and that's exactly thetype of systems that we're building soyou you mentioned you've open sourcedalpha fold and even the data involvedto me personally alsoreally happy and a big thank you foropen sourcing mijokouh the physics simulation engine that'sthat's often used for robotics researchand so on so i think that's a prettygangster move uh so what what's thewhat's i mean this uhvery few companies or people would dothat kind of thing what's the philosophybehind that you know it's a case-by-casebasis and in both those cases we feltthat was the maximum benefit to humanityto do that and and the scientificcommunity in one case the robotics uhphysics community with mojoco sopurchased it we purchasedto obs we purchased it for the expressprinciple to open source it soum soyou know i hope people appreciate thatit's great to hear that you do and thenthe second thing was and mostly we didit because the person building it is uhuh would not it was not able to copewith supporting it anymore because itwas it got too big for him his amazingprofessor uh who who built it in thefirst place so we helped him out withthat and then with alpha folds evenbigger i would say and i think in thatcase we decided that there were so manydownstream applications of alpha fold umthat we couldn't possibly even imaginewhat they all were so the best way toaccelerate uh drug discovery and alsofundamental research would be to to umgive all that data away and and and theand the and the system itself um youknow it's been so gratifying to see whatpeople have done that within just oneyear which is a short amount of time inscience and uh it's been used byover 500 000 researchers have used it wethink that's almost every biologist inthe world i think there's roughly 500000 biologists in the world professionalbiologists have used it to to look attheir proteins of interestwe've seen amazing fundamental researchdone so a couple of weeks ago frontcover there was a whole special issue ofscience including the front cover whichhad the nuclear pore complex on it whichis one of the biggest proteins in thebody the nuclear poor complex is aprotein that governs all the nutrientsgoing in and out of your cell nucleus sothey're like little hole gateways thatopen and close to let things go in andout of your cell nucleus so they'rereally important but they're hugebecause they're massive doughnut ringsshaped things and they've been lookingto try and figure out that structure fordecades and they have lots of you knowexperimental data but it's too lowresolution there's bits missing and theywere able to like a giant lego jigsawpuzzle use alpha fold predictions plusexperimental data and combined those twoindependent sources of information uhactually four different groups aroundthe world were able to put it togetherthe sec more or less simultaneouslyusing alpha fault predictions so that'sbeen amazing to see and pretty muchevery pharma company every drug companyexecutive i've spoken to has said thattheir teams are using alpha fold toaccelerate whatever drugs uh uh they'retrying to discover so i think theknock-on effect has been enormous interms of uh the impact that uhalpha-fold has made and it's probablybringing in it's creating biologistsit's bringing more people into the fieldumboth on the excitement and both on thetechnical skills involvedand umit's almost like uh a gateway drug tobiology yes it is you get morecomputational people involved toohopefully and and i think for us youknow the next stage as i said you knowin future we have to have otherconsiderations too we're building on topof alpha fold and these other ideas idiscussed with you about protein proteininteractions and and genomics and otherthings and not everything will be opensource some of it will will docommercially because that will be thebest way to actually get the mostresources and impact behind it in otherways some other projects will donon-profit style um and also we have toconsider for future things as wellsafety and ethics as well like but youknow synthetic biology there are youknow there is dual use and we have tothink about that as well with alpha foldwe you know we consulted with 30different bioethicists and and otherpeople expert in this field to make sureit was safe before um we released it sothere'll be other considerations infuture but for right now you know ithink alpha fold is a kind of a giftfrom us to to to the scientificcommunity so i'm pretty surethatsomething like alpha folduh would be part of nobel prizes in thefuturebut us humans of course are horriblewith credit assignment so we'll ofcourse give it to the humansdo you think there will be a daywhen ai systemcan't be deniedthat it earned that nobel prize do youthink we'll see that in 21st century itdepends what type of ais we end upbuilding right whether they're umyou know goal seeking agents whospecifies the goals uh who comes up withthe hypotheseswho you know who determines whichproblems to tackle right so i think it'sabout an announcement yeah so it'sannouncing the results exactly as partof it um so i think right now of courseit's it's it's it's amazing humaningenuity that's behind these systemsand then the system in my opinion isjust a tool you know it'd be a bit likesaying with galileo and his telescopeyou know the ingenuity the the thecredit should go to the telescope i meanit's clearly galileo building the toolwhich he then usesso i still see that in the same waytoday even though these tools learn forthemselves um they're i think i think ofthings like alpha fold and that thethings we're building as the ultimatetools for science and for acquiring newknowledge to help us as scientistsacquire new knowledge i think one daythere will come a point wherean ai system may solve or come up withsomething like general relativity of itsown bat not just byaveraging everything on the internet oraveraging everything on pubmedalthough that would be interesting tosee what that would come up with um sothat to me is a bit like our earlierdebate about creativity you knowinventing go rather than just coming upwith a good go move and um so i think uhsolving i think to to you know if wewanted to give it the credit of like anobel type of thing then it would needto invent go uh and sort of invent thatnew conjecture out of the blue um ratherthan being specified by the the humanscientists or the human creators so ithink right now that's it's definitelyjust a tool although it is interestinghow far you get by averaging everythingon the internet like you said becauseyou knowa lot of people do see science as you'realways standing on the shoulders ofgiants andthe question is how much are you reallyreachingup above the shoulders of giants maybeit's just assimilating different kindsofresults of the pastwith ultimately this new perspectivethat gives you this breakthrough ideabut that idea may not benovel in the way that we can't bealready discovered on the internet maybethe nobel prizesof the next 100 years are already allthere on the internet to be discoveredthey could be they could be i mean ithink umthis is one of the big mysteries i thinkis that uhuh i i first of all i believe a lot ofthe big new breakthroughs that are goingto come in the next few decades and evenin the last decade are going to come atthe intersection between differentsubject areas where um there'll be somenew connection that's found between whatseemingly with disparate areas and andone can even think of deep mind as isaid earlier as a sort ofinterdisciplinary between neuroscienceideas and ai engineering ideas uhoriginally and so um so i think there'sthat and then one of the things we can'timagine today is and one of the reasonsi think people we were so surprised byhow well large models worked is thatactuallyit's very hard for our human minds ourlimited human minds to understand whatit would be like to read the wholeinternet right i think we can do athought experiment and i used to do thisof like well what if i read the whole ofwikipediawhat would i know and i think our mindscan just about comprehend maybe whatthat would be like but the wholeinternet is beyond comprehension so ithink we just don't understand what itwould be like to be able to hold all ofthat in mind potentially right and thenactive at once and then maybe what arethe connections that are available thereso i think no doubt there are hugethings to be discovered just like thatbut i do think there is this other typeof creativity of true spark of newknowledge new idea never thought beforeabout can't be average from things thatare known um that really of courseeverything come you know nobody createsin a vacuum so there must be cluessomewhere but just a unique way ofputting those things together i thinksome of the greatest scientists inhistory have displayed that i would sayalthough it's very hard to know goingback to their time what was exactlyknown uh when they came up with thosethings althoughyou're making me really think becausejust the thought experiment of deeplyknowing a hundred wikipedia pagesi don't think i can umi've been really impressed by wikipediafor for technical topics yeah so if youknow a hundred pages or a thousand pagesi don't think who can visually trulycomprehend what'swhat kind of intelligence that is that'sa pretty powerful intelligence if youknow how to use that and integrate thatinformation correctly yes i think youcan go really far you can probablyconstruct thought experiments based onthatlike simulate different ideas so if thisis true let me run this thoughtexperiment then maybe this is true it'snot really invention it's like justtaking literally the knowledge and usingit to construct a very basic simulationof the world i mean some argue it'sromantic in part but einstein would dothe same kind of things with a thoughtexperiment yeah one could imagine doingthat systematically across millions ofwikipedia pages plus pubmed all thesethings i think there aremany many things to be discovered likethat they're hugely useful you know youcould imagine and i want us to do someof those things in material science likeroom temperature superconductors orsomething on my list one day i'd like tolike you know have an ai system to helpbuild better optimized batteries all ofthese sort of mechanical things mr ithink a systematic sort of search couldbe uhguided by a model could be um could beextremely powerful so speaking of whichyou have a paper on nuclear fusionuh magnetic control of tokamak plasmasto deep reinforcement learning so you uhyou're seeking to solve nuclear fusionwith deep rlso it's doing control of hightemperature plasmas can you explain thisworkand uh can ai eventually solve nuclearfusionit's been very fun last year or two andvery productive because we've beentaking off a lot of mydream projects if you like of thingsthat i've collected over the years ofareas of science that i would like to ithink could be very transformative if wehelped accelerate and uh reallyinteresting problems scientificchallenges in of themselvesthis is energy so energy yes exactly soenergy and climate so we talked aboutdisease and biology as being one of thebiggest places i think ai can help withi think energy and climate uh is anotherone so maybe they would be my top two umand fusion is one one area i think aican help with now fusion has manychallenges mostly physics materialscience and engineering challenges aswell to build these massive fusionreactors and contain the plasma and whatwe try to do whenever we go into a newfieldto apply our systems is we look for umwe talk to domain experts we try andfind the best people in the world tocollaborate with umin this case in fusion we wecollaborated with epfl in switzerlandthe swiss technical institute who areamazing they have a test reactor thatthey were willing to let us use whichyou know i double checked with the teamwe were going to use carefully andsafelyi was impressed they managed to persuadethem to let us use it and um and it's ait's an amazing test reactor they havethere and they try all sorts of prettycrazy experiments on it and um the thethe what we tend to look at is if we gointo a new domain like fusion what areall the bottleneck problems uh likethinking from first principles you knowwhat are all the bottleneck problemsthat are still stopping fusion workingtoday and then we look at we you know weget a fusion expert to tell us and thenwe look at those bottlenecks and we lookat the ones which ones are amenable toour ai methods today yes right and andand then and would be interesting from aresearch perspective from our point ofview from an ai point of view and thatwould address one of their bottlenecksand in this case plasma control was wasperfect so you know the plasma it's amillion degrees celsius something likethat it's hotter than the sunand there's obviously no material thatcan contain it so they have to becontaining these magnetic very powerfulsuperconducting magnetic fields but theproblem is plasma is pretty unstable asyou imagine you're kind of holding amini sun mini star in a reactor so youknow you you kind of want to predictahead of timewhat the plasma's going to do so you canmove the magnetic field within a fewmilliseconds you know to to basicallycontain what it's going to do next so itseems like a perfect problem if youthink of it for like a reinforcementlearning prediction problem so uh youknow your controller you're gonna movethe magnetic field and until we camealong you know they were they were doingit with with traditional operational uhresearch type of uh controllers uh whichare kind of handcrafted and the problemis of course they can't react in themoment to something the plasma's doingthat they have to be hard-coded andagain knowing that that's normally ourgo-to solution is we would like to learnthat instead and they also had asimulator of these plasma so there werelots of criteria that matched what we welike to to to useso can ai eventually solve nuclearfusion well so we with this problem andwe published it in a nature paper lastyear uh we held the fusion that we heldthe plasma in specific shapes soactually it's almost like carving theplasma into different shapes and controland hold it there for the record amountof time so um so that's one of theproblems of of fusion sort of um solvedso i have a controller that's able to nomatter the shape uh contain it continueyeah contain it and hold it in structureand there's different shapes that arebetter for for the energy productionscalled droplets and and and so on so umso that was huge and now we're lookingwe're talking to lots of fusion startupsto see what's the next problem we cantackle uh in the fusion areaso another fascinating placein a paper title pushing the frontiersof density functionals by solving thefractional electron problem so you'retaking onmodeling and simulating the quantummechanical behavior of electrons yesumcan you explain this work and can aimodel and simulate arbitrary quantummechanical systems in the future yeah sothis is another problem i've had my eyeon for you know a decade or more whichis umuh sort of simulating the properties ofelectrons if you can do that you canbasically describe how elements andmaterials and substances work so it'skind of like fundamental if you want toadvance material science um and uh youknow we have schrodinger's equation andthen we have approximations to thatdensity functional theory these thingsare you know are famous and um peopletry and write approximations to to theseuh uh to these functionals and and kindof come up with descriptions of theelectron clouds where they're gonna gohow they're gonna interact when you puttwo elements together uh and what we tryto do is learn a simulation uh uhlearner functional that will describemore chemistry types of chemistry so umuntil now you know you can run expensivesimulations but then you can onlysimulate very small uh molecules verysimple molecules we would like tosimulate large materials um and so uhtoday there's no way of doing that andwe're building up towards uh buildingfunctionals that approximateschrodinger's equation and then allowyou to describe uh what the electronsare doingand all materials sort of science andmaterial properties are governed by theelectrons and and how they interact sohave a good summarization of thesimulation through the functionalumbut one that is stillclose to what the actual simulationwould come out with so what umhow difficult is that to ask what'sinvolved in that task is it runningthosethose complicated simulations yeah andlearning the task of mapping from theinitial conditions and the parameters ofthe simulation learning what thefunctional would be yeah so it's prettytricky and we've done it with um youknow the nice thing is we there are wecan run a lot of the simulations thatthe molecular dynamics simulations onour compute clusters and so thatgenerates a lot of data so in this casethe data is generated so we like thosesort of systems and that's why we usegames simulator generated dataand we can kind of create as much of itas we want really um and just let'sleave some you know if any computers arefree in the cloud we just run we runsome of these calculations right computecluster calculation that's all the thefree compute times used up on quantummechanics quantum mechanics exactlysimulations and protein simulations andother things and so um and so you knowwhen you're not searching on youtube forvideo cat videos we're using thosecomputers usefully and quantum chemistrythat's the ideaand and putting them for good use andthen yeah and then all of thatcomputational data that's generated wecan then try and learn the functionalsfrom that which of course are way moreefficientonce we learn the functional than umrunning those simulations would bedo you think one day ai may allow us todo something like basically crack openphysics so do something like travelfaster than the speed of lightmy ultimate aim has always been with aiisum the reason i am personally working onai for my whole life it was to build atool to help us understand stand theuniverse so i wanted to and that meansphysics really and the nature of realitysoumuh i don't think we have systems thatare capable of doing that yet but whenwe get towards agi i think um that's oneof the first things i think we shouldapply agi toi would like to test the limits ofphysics and our knowledge of physicsthere's so many things we don't knowthere's one thing i find fascinatingabout science and you know as a hugeproponent of the scientific method asbeing one of the greatest ideashumanity's ever had and allowed us toprogress with our knowledgebut i think as a true scientist i thinkwhat you find is the more you find outuh you the more you realize we don'tknowand and i always think that it'ssurprising that more people don't aren'ttroubled you know every night i thinkabout all these things we interact withall the time that we have no idea howthey work timeconsciousness gravitylife we can't i mean these are all thefundamental things of nature i think theway we don't really know what they areto live life we uh pin certainassumptions on them and kind of treatour assumptions as if they're a factyeah that allows us to sort of box themoff somehow yeah box them offbut the reality is when you think oftimeyou should remind yourself you shouldput it off the shtake it off the shelf and realize likeno we have a bunch of assumptionsthere's still a lot of there's even nowa lot of debate there's a lot ofuncertainty about exactly what is timeuh is there an error of time you knowthere's there's a lot of fundamentalquestions you can't just makeassumptions about and maybeai allows you to umnot put anything on the shelfyeah not make any uh hard assumptionsand really open it up and see whatexactly i think we should be trulyopen-minded about that and uh exactlythat not be dogmatic to a particulartheoryum it'll also allow us to build bettertools experimental tools eventuallythat can then test certain theories thatmay not be testable today about asthings about likewhat we spoke about at the beginningabout the computational nature of theuniverse how one might if that was truehow one might go about testing thatright and and how much uh you know thereare people who've conjectured peoplelike uh scott aronson and others aboutuh you know how much information can aspecific planck unit of space and timecontain right so one might be able tothink about testing those ideas if youhad umai helping you build some new exquisiteuh uh experimental tools this is what iimagine you know many decades from nowwe'll be able to doand what kind ofquestions can be answered throughrunning a simulationof of them so there's a bunch of physicssimulations you can imagine that couldbe runin an uh so some kind of efficient waymuch like you're doing in the quantumsimulation workand perhaps even the origin of life sofiguring out howgoing even back before the work of alphafault begins of how this whole wholethingum emerges from a rock yes from a staticthing would what do you do you think aiwill allow us to is that something youhave your eye on it's trying tounderstand the origin of life first ofall yourselfwhat do you thinkumhow the heck did life originate on earthyeah well maybe we i'll come to that ina second but i think the ultimateuse of ai is tokind of use it to accelerate science tothe maximum so ium think of it a little bit like thetree of all knowledge if you imaginethat's all the knowledge there is in theuniverse to attainand we sort of barely scratched thesurface of that so far in even thoughyou know we've we've done pretty wellsince the enlightenment right ashumanity and i think ai will turbocharge all of that like we've seen withalpha fold and i want to explore as muchof that tree of knowledge as it'spossible to do and um and i think thatinvolves ai helping us with with withunderstanding or finding patterns um butalso potentially designing and buildingnew tools experimental tools so i thinkthat's all uhand also running simulations andlearning simulations all of that we'realready we're sort of doing it at a at aat a you know baby steps level here buti can imagine that in in in the decadesto come as uh you know what's the fullflourishing of of that line of thinkingit's going to be truly incredible iwould say if i visualize this tree ofknowledge something tells me that thatknowledge for tree of knowledge forhumans is much smallerin the set of all possible trees ofknowledge is actually quite small givingour cognitivelimitationslimited cognitive capabilities that evenwith with the tools we build we stillwon't be able to understand a lot ofthings and that's perhaps what non-humansystems might be able to reach farthernot just as toolsbut in themselves understandingsomething that they can bring back yeahit could well be so i mean there's somany things that that are sort ofencapsulated in what you just said therei think first of all umthere's there's two different thingsthere's like what do we understand todayyeah what could the human mindunderstand and what is the totality ofwhat is there to be understood yeahright and so there's three consensus youknow you can think of them as threelarger and larger trees or exploringmore branches of that tree and i i thinkwith ai we're going to explore thatwhole lot now the question is is uh youknow if you think about what is thetotality of what could be understood umthere may be some fundamental physicsreasons why certain things can't beunderstood like what's outside thesimulation or outside the universe maybeit's not understandable from within theuniverseso that's there may be some hardconstraints like that you know it couldbe smaller constraints likeum we think of space time as fundamentalus our human brains are really used tothis idea of a three-dimensional worldwith time rightmaybe but our tools could go beyond thatthey wouldn't have that limitationnecessary they could think in 11dimensions 12 dimensions whatever isneeded but um we could still maybeunderstand that in several differentways the example i always give is umwhen i you know play gary kasparov atspeed chess or we've talked about chessand these kind of things um you know heif you if you if you're reasonably goodat chess you can um you can't come upwith the move gary comes up with in hismove but he can explain it to you andyou can understand and you canunderstand post hoc the reasoning yeahso so i think there's a there's an evenfurther level of like well maybe youcouldn't have invented that thing butbut using like going back to usinglanguage again perhaps you canunderstand and appreciate that same waylike you can appreciate you know vivaldior mozart or something without you canappreciate the beauty of that without umbeing able to to construct it yourselfright invent the music yourself so ithink we see this in all forms of lifeso it'll be that times you knowa million but it would you can imaginealso one sign of intelligence is theability to explain things clearly andsimply right you know people likerichard feynman another one of myall-time heroes used to say that rightif you can't you know if you can explainit something simply then you that's athat's the best sign a complex topicsimply then that's one of the best signsof you understanding it yeah so i cansee myself talking trash in the aisystem in that way yes uhit gets frustrated how dumb i am andtrying to explain something to me i waslike well that means you're notintelligent because if you wereintelligent you'd be able to explain itsimply yeah of course you know there'salso the other option of course we couldenhance ourselves and and withoutdevices we we are already sort ofsymbiotic with our compute devices rightwith our phones and other things and youknow this stuff like neural link and etcthat could be could could advance thatfurther um so i think there's lots oflots of really amazing possibilities uhthat i could foresee from here well letme ask you some wild questions so outtherelooking for friendsdo you think there's a lot of aliencivilizations out thereso i guess this also goes back to yourorigin of life question too because ithink that that's keyummy personal opinion looking at all thisand and you know it's one of my hobbiesphysics i guess so so i i you know it'ssomething i think about a lot and talkto a lot of experts on and and and reada lot of books on and i thinkmy feeling currently is that that we arealone i think that's the most likelyscenario given what what evidence wehave so um and the reasoning is i thinkthatyou know we've tried since uh thingslike seti program and i guess since thedawning of the the space age uh we'veyou know had telescopes open radiotelescopes and other things and if youthink about um and try to detect signalsnow if you think about the evolution ofhumans on earth we could have easilybeen um a million years ahead of ourtime now or million years behind quiteeasily with just some slightly differentquirk thing happening hundreds ofthousands years ago uh you know thingscould have been slightly different ifthe bto had hit the dinosaurs a millionyears earlier maybe things would haveevolved uh we'd be a million yearsahead of where we are now so what thatmeans is if you imagine where humanitywill be in a few hundred years let alonea million years especially if wehopefully umyou know solve things like climatechange and other things and we continueto flourishand we build things like ai and we dospace traveling and all of the stuffthat that humans have dreamed of forforever right and sci-fi has talkedabout forever umwe will be spreading across the starsright and void neumann famouslycalculated you know it would only takeabout a million years if you send outvon neumann probes to the nearest youknow the nearest uh uh other solarsystems and and then they built all theydid was build two more versions ofthemselves and set those two out to thenext nearest systems uh you you knowwithin a million years i think you wouldhave one of these probes in every systemin the galaxy so it's not actually incosmo cosmological time that's actuallya very short amount of timeso and and you know we've people likedyson have thought about constructingdyson spheres around stars to collectall the energy coming out of the staryou know that there would beconstructions like that would be visibleacross base um probably even across agalaxy so and then you know if you thinkabout all of our radio television uhemissions that have gone out since sincethe you know 30s and 40s um imagine amillion years of that and now hundredsof civilizations doing that when weopened our ears at the point we gottechnologically sophisticated enough inthe space age we should haveheard a cacophony of voices we shouldhave joined that cacophony of voices andwhat we did we opened our ears and weheard nothingand many people who argue that there arealiens would say well we haven't reallydone exhaustive search yet and maybewe're looking in the wrong bands and andwe've got the wrong devices and wewouldn't notice what an alien form waslike to be so different to what we'reused to but you know i'm not i don'treally buy that that it shouldn't be asdifficult as that like we i think we'vesearched enough there should be if itwere everywhere if it was it should beeverywhere we should see dyson's fearsbeing put up sun's blinking in and outyou know there should be a lot ofevidence for those things and then thereare other people argue well the sort ofsafari view of like well we're aprimitive species still because we'renot space faring yet and and and we'reyou know there's some kind of globe likeuniversal rule not to interfere startrek rule but like look look we can'teven coordinate humans to deal withclimate change and we're one specieswhat is the chance that of all of thesedifferent human civilization you knowalien civilizations they would have thesame priorities and and and and agreeacross you know these kind of mattersand even if that was true and we were insome sort of safari for our own good tome that's not much different from thesimulation hypothesis because what doesit mean the simulation hypothesis ithink in its most fundamental level itmeans what we're seeing is not quitereality right it's something there'ssomething more deeper underlying itmaybe computational now if we were in aif we were in a sort of safari park andeverything we were seeing was a hologramand it was projected by the aliens orwhatever that to me is not muchdifferent than thinking we're inside ofanother universe because we still can'tsee true reality right i mean there'sthere's other explanations it could bethatthe way they're communicating is justfundamentally different that we're toodumb to understand the much bettermethods of communication they have itcould be i mean i mean it's silly to saybutour own thoughts could be the methods bywhich they're communicating like theplace from which our ideas writers talkabout this like the muse yeahit sounds like very kind of uhwild but it could be thoughts it couldbesome interactions with our mind that wethink are originating fromus is actually something that uhis coming from other life formselsewhere consciousness itself might bethat it could be but i don't see anysensible argument to the why why wouldall of the alien species be using thisway yes some of them will be moreprimitive they would be close to ourlevel you know there would there shouldbe a whole sort of normal distributionof these things right some would beaggressive some would be you knowcurious others would be very stoical andphilosophical because you know maybethey're a million years older than usbut it's not it shouldn't be like what imean one one alien civilization might belike that communicating thoughts andothers but i don't see why you knowpotentially the hundreds there should bewould be uniform in this way right itcould be a violent dictatorship that thethe people the alien civilizations thatuh become successfulbecome um[Music]gain the ability to be destructive anorder of magnitude more destructivebut of course the the sad thoughtwelleither humans are very special we took alot of leaps that arrived at what itmeans to be human yeahumthere's a question there which was thehardest which was the most special butalso if others have reached this leveland maybe many others have reached thislevelthe great filterthat prevented them from going fartherto becoming a multi-planetary species orreaching out into the starsand those are really important questionsfor us whetherumwhether there's other aliencivilizations out there or not this isvery useful for us to think about if wedestroy ourselveshow will we do it and how easy is it todo yeah well you know these are bigquestions and i've thought about these alot but the the the interesting thing isthat if we're if we're alonethat's somewhat comforting from thegreat filter perspective because itprobably means the great filters wereare past us and i'm pretty sure they areso that by in going back to your originof life question there are someincredible things that no one knows howhappened like obviously the firstlife form from chemical soup that seemspretty hard but i would guess themulticellular i wouldn't be thatsurprised if we saw singlesingle cell sort of life forms elsewhereuh bacteria type things butmulticellular life seems incredibly hardthat step of you know capturingmitochondria and then sort of using thatas part of yourself you know when you'vejust eaten it would you say that's thebiggestthe most uh likeif if you had to choose one sort of uhhitchhiker's got this galaxy onesentence summary of like oh those clevercreatures did this that would be themultilist i think that was probably theone that that's the biggest i meanthere's a great book called the 10 grandgreat inventions of evolution by nicklane and he speculates on 10 10 of theseyou know what could be great filters umi think that's one i think the theadvent of of intelligence and andconscious intelligence and in order youknow to us to be able to do science andthings like that is huge as well i meanit's only evolved once as far as youknow uh in in earth history so thatwould be a later candidate but there'scertainly for the early candidates ithink multicellular life forms is hugeby the way what it's interesting to askyou if you can hypothesize aboutwhat is the origin of intelligence is ituhthat we startedcooking meat over fireis it that we somehow figured out thatwe could be very powerful when we startcollaborating so cooperation betweenum our ancestorsso that we can overthrow the alpha maleuh what is it richard i talked torichard randham who thinks we're alljust beta males who figured out how tocollaborate to defeat the one thedictator the authoritarian alpha maleum that control the tribe um is thereother explanation did was there um 2001space out any type of monolith yeah thatcame down to earth well i i think um ithink all of those things you suggestfor good candidates fire and and andcooking right so that's clearlyimportantyou know energy efficiency yeah cookingour meat and then and then being able toto to be more efficient about eating itand getting it consuming the energy um ithink that's huge and then utilizingfire and tools i think you're rightabout the the tribal cooperation aspectsand probably language as part of thatyes um because probably that's whatallowed us to outcompete neanderthalsand and perhaps less cooperative speciesso um so that may be the case toolmaking spears axes i think that let us imean i think it's pretty clear now thathumans were responsible for a lot of theextinctions of megafauna um especiallyin in the americas when humans arrivedso uh you can imagine once you discovertool usage how powerful that would havebeen and how scary for animals so ithink all of those could have beenexplanations for it you know theinteresting thing is that it's a bitlike general intelligence too is it'svery costly to begin with to have abrainand especially a general purpose brainrather than a special purpose onebecause the amount of energy our brainsuse i think it's like 20 of the body'senergy and it's it's massive and whenyou're thinking chest one of the funnythings that that we used to say is asmuch as a racing driver uses for a wholeyou know formula one race if justplaying a game of you know serious highlevel chess which you you know youwouldn't think just sitting there umbecause the brain's using so much uhenergy so in order for an animal anorganism to justify that there has to bea huge payoff and the problem with withhalf a brain or half you knowintelligence saying iqs of you knowof like a monkey brain it'sit's not clear you can justify thatevolutionary until you get to the humanlevel brain and so but how do you how doyou do that jump it's very difficultwhich is why i think it's only been doneonce from the sort of specialized brainsthat you see in animals to this sort ofgeneral purpose chewing powerful brainsthat humans have um and which allows usto invent the modern modern world um anduh you know it takes a lot to to crossthat barrier and i think we've seen thesame with ai systems which is that uhmaybe until very recently it's alwaysbeen easier to craft a specific solutionto a problem like chess than it has beento build a general learning system thatcould potentially do many things becauseinitially uh that system will be wayworse than uh less efficient than thespecialized system so one of theinterestingquirks of the human mind of this evolvedsystem is that it appears to beconsciousthis thing that we don't quiteunderstand but it seems veryvery special its ability to have asubjective experience that it feels likesomethingto eat a cookie the deliciousness of itor see a color and that kind of stuff doyou think in order to solve intelligencewe also need to solve consciousnessalong the way do you think agi systemsneed to have consciousness in order tobetruly intelligent yeah we thought aboutthis a lot actually and um i think thatmy guess is that consciousness andintelligence are double dissociable soyou can have one without the other bothways and i think you can see that withconsciousness in that i think someanimals and pets if you have a pet dogor something like that you can see someof the higher animals and dolphinsthings like that are uh haveself-awareness and uh very sociable umseem to dream um you know those kinds ofa lot of the traits one would regard asbeing kind of conscious and self-awareum and but yet they're not that smartright uh so they're not that intelligentby by say iq standards or something likethat yeah it's also possible that ourunderstanding of intelligence is flawedlike putting an iq to it sure maybe thething that a dog can dois actually gone very far along the pathof intelligence and we humans are justable toplay chess and maybe write poems rightbut if we go back to the idea of agi andgeneral intelligence you know dogs arevery specialized right most animals arepretty specialized they can be amazingat what they do but they're like kind ofelite sports sports people or somethingright so they do one thing extremelywell because their entire brain is isoptimized they have somehow convincedthe entirety of the human population tofeed them and service them so in someway they're controlling yes exactly wellwe co-evolved to some crazy degree rightuh including the the way the dogs youknow even even wag their tails andtwitch their noses right we find we'refinding inexorably cute yeah um but ithink um you can also see intelligenceon the other side so systems likeartificial systems that are amazinglysmart at certain things like maybeplaying go and chess and other thingsbut they don't feel at all in any shapeor form conscious in the way that youknow you do to me or i do to you and umand i think actuallybuilding aiis uh these intelligent constructs uh isone of the best ways to explore themystery of consciousness to break itdown because um we're going to havedevices that arepretty smart at certain things orcapable of certain things butpotentially won't have any semblance ofself-awareness or other things and infact i would advocateif there's a choice building systems inthe first place ai systems that are notconscious to begin with uh are justtools um until we understand them betterand the capabilities better so on thattopic just notas the ceo of deep mindjust as a human being let me ask youabout this one particular anecdotalevidence of the google engineerwho made a commentorbelieved that there's some aspect of alanguage modelthe lambda language model that exhibitedsentienceso you said you believe there might be aresponsibility to build systems that arenot essential and this experience of aparticular engineer i think i'd love toget your general opinion on this kind ofthing but i think it will happen moreand more and morewhich uh not when engineers but whenpeople out there that don't have anengineering background start interactingwith increasingly intelligent systemswe anthropomorphize them they they startto have deep impactfulum interactions with us in a way that wemiss them yeah when they're goneandwe sure feel like they'reliving entities self-aware entities andmaybe even we project sentience ontothem so what what's your thought aboutthis particularuh system was is uhhave you ever met a language modelthat's sentientno i no no what do you make of the caseof when you kind offeelthat there's some elements of sentienceto this system yeah so this is you knowan interesting question and uh uhobviously a very fundamental one sofirst thing to say is i think thatnone of the systems we have today i iwould say even have one iota of uhsemblance of consciousness or sentiencethat's my personal feeling interactingwith them every day so i think that'sway premature to be discussing what thatengineer talked about i appreciate ithink at the moment it's more of aprojection of the way our own minds workwhich is to seeuh uh uh sort of purpose and directionin almost anything that we you know ourbrains are trained to interpret uhagency basically in things uh even thean inanimate thing sometimes and ofcourse with a a language system becauselanguage is so fundamental tointelligence that's going to be easy forus to anthropomorphize thati mean back in the day even the first uhyou know the dumbest sort of templatechatbots ever eliza and and and and theilk of the original chatbots back in the60s fooled some people under certaincircumstances right they pretended to bea psychologist so just basically rabbitback to you the same question you askedit back to you umand uh some people believe that so idon't think we can this is why i thinkthe turing test is a little bit flawedas a formal test because it depends onthe sophistication of the of the judgeum whether or not they are qualified tomake that distinction soi think we should uh talk to you knowthe the top philosophers about thispeople like daniel dennett and uh davidchalmers and others who've obviouslythought deeply about consciousness ofcourse consciousness itself hasn't beenwell there's no agreed definition if iwas to you know uh speculate about thatuh you know i kind of the definite theworking definition i like is it's theway information feels when you know itgets processed i think maybe max tegmarkcame up with that i like that idea idon't know if it helps us get towardsany more operational thing but but it'sit's it's i think it's a nice way ofviewing it um i think we can obviouslysee from neuroscience certainprerequisites that are required likeself-awareness i think is necessary butnot sufficient component this idea of aself and other and set of coherentpreferences that are coherent over timeyou know these things are maybe memoryum these things are probably needed fora sentient or conscious being um but butthe reason that the difficult thing ithink for us when we get and i thinkthis is a really interestingphilosophical debate is when we getcloser to agi and and and you knowand and much more powerful systems thanwe have todayum how are we going to make thisjudgment and one way which is the turingtest is sort of a behavioral judgment isis the system exhibiting all thebehaviors um that a human sentient uh ora sentient being would would wouldexhibit um is it answering the rightquestions is it saying the right thingsis it indistinguishable from a human umand so onbut i think there's a second thing thatmakes us as humans regard each other assentient right why do we why do we thinkthis and i debated this with danieldennett and i think there's a secondreason that's often overlooked which isthat we're running on the same substrateright so if we're exhibiting the samebehavior uh more or less as humans andwe're running on the same you knowcarbon-based biological substrate thesquishy you know few pounds of of fleshin our skulls then the most parsimoniousi think explanation is that you'refeeling the same thing as i'm feelingright but we will never have that secondpart the substrate equivalence with amachineright so we will have to only judgebased on the behavior and i think thesubstrate equivalence is a critical partof why we make assumptions that we'reconscious and in fact even with withanimals high-level animals why we thinkthey might be because they're exhibitingsome of the behaviors we would expectfrom a sentient animal and we knowthey're made of the same thingsbiological neurons so we're gonna haveto come up withexplanations uh or models of the gapbetween substrate differences betweenmachines and humans did to get anywherebeyond the behavioral but to me sort ofthe practical question isvery interesting and very important whenyou have millions perhaps billions ofpeople believing that you have ascensionai believing what that google engineerbelievedwhich i just see is an obviousvery near-term future thing certainly onthe path to agihow does that change the worldwhat's the responsibility of the aisystem to help those millions of peopleand also what's the ethical thingbecauseyou can you can make a lot of peoplehappyby creating a meaningful deep experiencewith a systemthat's faking it before it makes it yeahand i i don'tis a are we the right or who is to saywhat's the right thing to do should aialways be tools like why why why are weconstraining ais to always be tools asopposed tofriends yeah i think well i mean theseare you know you know fantasticquestions and and also critical ones andwe've been thinking about this uh sincethe start of d minor before that becausewe planned for success and you know howhow you know you know however remotethat looked like back in 2010 and we'vealways had sort of these ethicalconsiderations as fundamental atdeepmind um and my current thinking onthe language models is and and largemodels is they're not ready we don'tunderstand them well enough yet um andyou know in terms of analysis tools andand guard rails what they can and can'tdo and so on to deploy them at scalebecause i think you know there are bigstill ethical questions like should anai system always announce that it is anai system to begin with probably yes umit what what do you do about answeringthose philosophical questions about thefeelings uh people may have about aisystems perhaps incorrectly attributedso i think there's a whole bunch ofresearch that needs to be done first umto responsibly before you know you canresponsibly deploy these systems atscale that would be at least be mycurrent positionover time i'm very confident we'll havethose tools like interpretabilityquestions umand uh analysis questions uh and thenwith the ethical quandary you know ithink thereit's important touh look beyond just science that's why ithink philosophy social sciences eventheology other things like that comeinto it where um what you know arts andhumanities what what does it mean to behuman and the spirit of being human andand to enhance that and and the humancondition right and allow us toexperience things we could neverexperience before and improve the theoverall human condition and humanityoverall you know get radical abundancesolve many scientific problems solvedisease so this is the era i think thisis the amazing era i think we're headinginto if we do it right um but we've gotto be careful we've already seen withthings like social media how dual usetechnologies can be misused by firstlyby by by bad you know p bad actors ornaive actors or crazy actors right sothere's that set of just the common orgarden misuse of existing dual usetechnology and then of course there's anadditional uh uh thing that has to beovercome with ai that eventually it mayhave its own agency so it could be uh uhuh good or bad in in in of itself so ithink these questions have to beapproached very carefully um using thescientific method i would say in termsof hypothesis generation careful controltesting not live a b testing out in theworld because with powerful dualtechnologies like aiif something goes wrong it may cause youknow a lot of harm before you can fix itum it's not like a you know an imagingapp or game app where you know that ifif something goes wrong it's relativelyeasy to fix and and the harm'srelatively small so i thinkit comes with you know the the the usualuh cliche of like with a lot of powercomes a lot of responsibility and ithink that's the case here with thingslike ai given the the enormousopportunity in front of us and i thinkwe need a lot of voices uh and as manyinputs into things like the design ofthe systems and the valuesthey should have and what goals shouldthey be put to um i think as wide agroup of voices as possible beyond justthe technologies is needed uh to inputinto that and to have a say in thatespecially when it comes to deploymentof these systems which is when therubber really hits the road it reallyaffects the general person in the streetrather than fundamental research andthat's why i sayi think as a first step it would bebetter if we have the choice to buildthese systems as tools to give and i'mnot saying that it should never theyshould never go beyond tools because ofcourse the potential is there um for itto go way beyond just tools uh but um ithink that would be a good first stepin order for us to you know allow us tocarefully experiment understand whatthese things can do so the leap betweentool to sentient entity being is oneshould take very careful yeslet me ask a dark personal questionso you're one of the most brilliantpeople in the ag community also one ofthe mostkindand uh if i may say sort of loved peoplein the community that saiduhcreation of a super intelligent aisystemwould be one of the mostpowerfulthings in the world tools or otherwiseand again as the old saying goes powercorrupts and absolute power cropsabsolutelyyou arelikelyto be one of the peoplei would say probably the most likelyperson to be in the control of such asystemdo you think aboutthe corrupting nature of power when youtalk about these kinds of systems thatum as all dictatorsand people have caused atrocities in thepast always think they're doing goodbut they don't do good because thepowers polluted their mind about what isgood and what is evil do you think aboutthis stuff or are we just focused onlanguage modeling no i think about themall the time and you know i thinkwhat are the defenses against that ithink one thing is to remain verygrounded and sort of humble uh no matterwhat you do or achieve and i try to dothat i might you know my best friendsare still my set of friends from myundergraduate cambridge days my family'syou know and and friends are veryimportantumi've always i think trying to be amulti-disciplinary person it helps tokeep you humble because no matter howgood you are at one topic someone willbe better than you at that and it andalways relearning a new topic again fromscratch is or new field is very humblingright so for me that's been biology overthe last five years you know huge areatopic and and and it's been and i justlove doing that but it helps to keep yougrounded like it keeps you open-mindedandand then the other important thing is tohave a really good amazing set of uhpeople around you at your company oryour organization who are also veryethical and grounded themselves and helpto keep you that wayand then ultimately just to answer yourquestion i hope we're going to be a bigpart of of birthing ai and that beingthe greatest benefit to humanity of anytool or technology ever and and gettingus into a world of radical abundance andcuring diseases andand and solving many of the bigchallenges we have in front of us andthen ultimately you know help theultimate flourishing of humanity totravel the stars and find those aliensif they are there and if they're notthere find out why they're not therewhat what is going on here in theuniverse um this is all to come and andthat's what i've always dreamed about umbut i don't think i think ai is too bigan idea it's not going to be uh there'llbe a certain set of pioneers who getthere first i hopewe're in the vanguard so we caninfluence how that goes and i think itmatters who builds who which whichcultures they come from and what valuesthey have uh the builders of ai systemsbecause i think even though the aisystem is going to learn for itself mostof its knowledge there'll be a residuein the system of the culture and thevalues of the creators of the system umand there's interesting questions to todiscuss about that geopolitically youknow different cultures as we're in amore fragmented world than everunfortunately i think in terms of globalcooperationwe see that in things like climate wherewe can't seem to get our act together uhglobally to cooperate on these pressingmatters i hope that will change overtime perhaps you know if we get to anera of radical abundance we don't haveto be so competitive anymore maybe wecan be more cooperativeif resources aren't so scarce it's truethatin terms ofpower corrupting and leading todestructive things it seems that some ofthe atrocities of the past happen whenthere's a significantconstraint on resources i think that'sthe first thing i don't think that'senough i think scarcity is one thingthat's led to competition destruct youknow sort of zero sum game thinking iwould like us to all be in a positivesum world and i think for that you haveto remove scarcity i don't think that'senough unfortunately to get world peacebecause there's also other corruptingthings like wanting power over peopleand this kind of stuff which is notnecessarily satisfied by by justabundance but i think it will help umand i think uh but i think ultimately aiis not going to be run by any one personor one organization i think it shouldbelong to the world belong to humanityum and i think maybe many there'll bemany ways this will happen andultimately umeverybody should have a say in thatdo you have advicefor uh young people in high school andcollege maybe umif they're interested in ai orinterested in having abig impact on the world what they shoulddo to have a career they can be proud ofher to have a life they can be proud ofi love giving talks to the nextgeneration what i say to them isactually two things i i think the mostimportant things to learn about and tofind out about when you're when you'reyoung is what are your true passions isfirst of all there's two things one isfind your true passions and i think youcan do that by the way to do that is toexplore as many things as possible whenyou're young and you you have the timeand you and you can take those risks umi would also encourage people to look atthe finding the connections betweenthingsin a unique way i think that's a reallygreat way to find a passion second thingi would say advise is know yourself sospend a lot of timeunderstanding how you work best likewhat are the optimal times to work whatare the optimal ways that you study umwhat are your how do you deal withpressuresort of test yourself in variousscenarios and try and improve yourweaknesses but also find out what yourunique skills and strengths are and thenhone those so then that's what will beyour super value in the world later onand if you can then combine those twothings and find passions that you'regenuinely excited about that intersectwith what your unique strong skills arethen you're you know you're on tosomething incredible and and you know ithink you can make a huge difference inthe world so let me ask about knowyourself this is fun this is fun quickquestions about day in the life theperfect day the perfect productive dayin the life of demise's house yeah maybeuh maybe these days you're umthere's a lot involved yeah it may be aslightly youngeryou could focus on a demonstrationproject maybe umhow early do you wake up are you nightowl do you wake up early in the morningwhat are some interesting habitsuh how many dozens of cups of coffees doyou drink a day what's the computer umthat you useuh what's the setup how many screenswhat kind of keyboard are we talking uhemacs vim are we talking something moremodern so it's a bunch of thosequestions so maybe uh day in the lifewhat what's the perfect day involvedwell these days it's quite differentfrom say 10 20 years ago back 10 20years ago it would have been you know awhole day ofresearch individual research orprogramming doing some experimentneuroscience computer science experimentreading lots of research papers uh andthen perhaps at night time you know umreading science fiction books or or uhplaying uh some games but lots of focusso like deep focused work on whetherit's uhprogramming or reading research paperyes yes so that would be a lot ofdebrief you know uh focused work thesedays for the last sort of i guess youknow five to ten years i've actually gotquite a structure that works very wellfor me now which is that um i'm a nightcomplete night out always have been so ioptimized for that so you know i get youknow i basically do a normal day's workget into work about 11 o'clock and sortof do work to about seven uh in theoffice uh and i will arrangeback-to-back meetings for the entiretime of that and with as many me as manypeople as possible so that's mycollaboration management part of the daythen i go home uh spend time with thefamily and friends uh have dinner uh uhrelax a little bit and then i start asecond day of work i call it my secondday work around 10 pm 11 p.m and that'sthe time till about the small hours ofthe morning four five in the morningwhere i will do my thinking and readinga research writing research papers umsadly don't have time to code anymorebut it's it's not efficient to to dothat uh these days uh given the amountof time i have um but that's when i doyou know maybe do the long kind ofstretches of of thinking and planningand then probably you know using usingemail or other things i would set iwould fire off a lot of things to myteam to deal with the next morning foractually thinking about this overnightwe should go for this project or arrangethis meeting the next day when you'rethinking through a problem are youtalking about a sheet of paper or thepatent pen is there some independentstructure yeah i like processes i stilllike pencil and paper best for workingout things but um these days it's justso efficient to read research papersjust on the screen i still often printthem out actually i still prefer tomark out things and i find it goes intothe brain quick better and sticks in thebrain better when you're you're stillusing physical pen and pencil and paperso you take notes with the i have lotsof nodes electronic ones and also umwhole stacks of notebooks thatum that i use at home yeah on some ofthese most challenging next steps forexample stuffnone of us know about that you'reworking on you're thinkingthere's some deep thinking requiredthere right like what what is the rightproblem what is the right approachbecause you're gonna have to invest ahuge amount of time for the whole teamthey're going to have to pursue thisthing what's the right way to do it isis rl going to work here or not yes umwhat's the right thing to try what's theright benchmark to use yeah we need toconstruct a benchmark from scratch allthose kinds of things yes so i think allthose kind of things in the night timephase but also much more um i find i'vealways found the quiet hours of themorning um when everyone's asleep it'ssuper quiet outside um i love that timeit's the golden hours like between likeone and three in the morning um put somemusic on some inspiring music on andthen um think these deep thoughts sothat's when i would read you know myphilosophy books and uh spinoza's my youknow recent favorite can all thesethings i i i you know read about a greatuh uha scientist of history how they didthings how they thought things so that'swhen you do all your create that's wheni do all my creative thinking and it'sgood i think i think people recommendyou know you do your your your sort ofcreative thinking in one block and theway i organize the day that way i don'tget interrupted because obviously no oneelse is up uh at those times so i can ican go uh you know as i can sort of getsuper deep and super into flow the othernice thing about doing it night timewise is if i'm really uh onto somethingor i've i've got really deep intosomething i can choose to extend it andi'll go into six in the morning whateverand then i'll just pay for it the nextday yeah cause i'll be a bit tired and iwon't be my best but that's fine i candecide looking at my schedule the nextday that and given where i'm at withthis particular thought or creative ideathat i'm going to pay that cost the nextday so so i think that's that's moreflexible than morning people who do thatyou know they get up at four in themorning they can also do those goldenhours then but then their start of theirschedule day starts at breakfast youknow 8 a.m whatever they have theirfirst meeting and then it's hard youhave to reschedule a day if you're inflow yeah that's going to be i don'thave to see that special threat ofthoughts thattheyou're too passionate about you thatthis is where some of the greatest ideascould potentially come is when you justlose yourself late into yeahand for the meetings i mean you'reloading in really hard problems in avery short amount of time so you have todo some kind of first principlesthinking here it's like what's theproblem what's the state of thingswhat's the right next step yes you haveto get really good at context switchingwhich is one of the hardest thingsbecause especially as we do so manythings if you include all the scientificthings we do scientific fields we'reworking in these are entire you knowcomplex fields in themselves and you youhave to sort of keep up to abreast ofthat but i enjoy it i've always been uha sort of generalist in a way and that'sactually what happened with my gamescareer after chess i i i one of thereasons i stopped playing chess was thati got into computers but also i startedrealizing there were many other greatgames out there to play too soi've always been that way inclinedmultidisciplinary and there's too manyinteresting things in in the world tospend all your time just on one thingso you mentioned spinoza gotta ask thebigridiculously big question about lifewhat do you think is the meaning of thiswhole thinguh why are we humans here you've alreadymentioned that perhaps the universecreated usis that why you think we're hereto understand how the universe yeah ithink my answer to that would be and atleast the the life i'm living is to gainand uh to gain and understand theknowledge you know to gain knowledge andunderstand the universe that's what ithink uh i can't see any higher purposethan that if you think back to theclassical greeks you know the virtue ofgaining knowledge it's uh i think it'sthat it's one of the few true virtues isto understand um the world around us andthe context and humanity better and umand i think if you do that you becomemore compassionate and moreunderstanding yourself and and moretolerant and all these i think all theseother things may flow from that and tomeyou know understanding the nature ofreality that is the biggest questionwhat is going on here is sometimes thecolloquial way i say what is reallygoing on hereuh it's so mysterious i feel like we'rein some huge puzzle and and it's but theworld is also seems to be the universeseems to be structured in a way you knowwhy is it structured in a way thatscience is even possible that you knowmethods the scientific method worksthings are repeatableum it feels like it's almost structuredin a way to be conducive to gainingknowledge so i feel like and you knowwhy should computers be even possibleisn't that amazing that uh computationalelectronic devices can can can can bepossible and they're made of sand ourmost you know common element that wehave you know silicon that on the on theearth's crust they could be made ofdiamond or something then we would haveonly had one computer yeah right so it'sa lot of things are kind of slightlysuspicious to me it sure as heck soundsthis puzzle sure sounds like somethingwe talked about earlier what it takes toto design a gamethat's really fun to play for prolongedperiods of timeand it does seem like this puzzle likeyou mentioned the more you learn aboutit the more you realize how little youknowso it humbles you but excites you by thepossibility of learning more it's oneheck of a one heck of a puzzle we gotgoing on here um so like i mentioned ofall the people in the world you're verylikely to be the one who creates the agisystemum that achieves human levelintelligence and goes beyond it so ifyou got a chance and very well you couldbe the person that goes into the roomwith the system and have a conversationmaybe you only get to ask one questionif you dowhat question would you ask heri would probably ask um what is the truenature of realityi think that's the question i don't knowif i'd understand the answer becausemaybe it would be 42 or something likethat but um that's the question i wouldaskand then there'll be a deep sigh fromthe systems like all right how do iexplain to the excuse me exactly allright let me i don't have timeto explain uh maybe i'll draw you apicture that it isi mean how do you even beginumto answer that questionwell i think it would um what would youwhat would you think the answer couldpossibly look like i think it could itcould start looking likeuhuh more fundamental explanations ofphysics would be the beginning you knowmore careful specification of thattaking you walking us through by thehand as to what one would do to maybeprove those things out maybe giving youglimpses ofwhat things you totally missed in thephysics of todayexactly just here here's glimpses of nolike there's a muchuha much more elaborate world or a muchsimpler world or somethinga much deeper maybe simpler explanationyes of things right than the standardmodel of physics which we know doesn'twork but we still keep adding to so umand and that's how i think the beginningof an explanation would look and itwould start encompassing many of themysteries that we have wondered aboutfor thousands of years like you knowconsciousnessuh life and gravity all of these thingsyeah giving us a glimpses ofexplanations for those things yeahwell umdamas dear one of the specialhuman beings in this giant puzzle ofours and it's a huge honor that youwould take a pause from the biggerpuzzle to solve this small puzzle of aconversation with me today it's truly anhonor and a pleasure thank you thank youi really enjoyed it thanks lexthanks for listening to thisconversation with demas establish tosupport this podcast please check outour sponsors in the descriptionand now let me leave you with some wordsfrom edskar dykstracomputer science is no more aboutcomputersthan astronomy is about telescopesthank you for listening and hope to seeyou next time\n"
